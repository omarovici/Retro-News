                        “Down with corruption, down with autocracy, down with dictators.” These were the chants by an
                        increasing number of Egyptians demanding the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, who had been
                        in power for 30 years.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        According to Amnesty International, more than 840 people were killed during the protests, which
                        ultimately led to Mubarak stepping down on February 11.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since then, Egypt experienced its first free and fair presidential election, followed by a
                        military coup in 2013, which rolled back many of the revolution’s gains.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But the uprising remains a cherished memory and a source of inspiration for many Egyptians.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here is a chronology of Egypt’s 18-day revolution:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        January 25
                        On a national holiday to commemorate the police force, thousands of Egyptians took to the
                        streets of downtown Cairo, calling it a “day of rage”. Similar protests were reported in other
                        towns across the country.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After a few hours of relative calm, police and demonstrators clashed with police who fired tear
                        gas and used water cannon against demonstrators.
