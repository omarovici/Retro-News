                        The US operation to kill or capture Osama Bin Laden was months in the planning but took just
                        minutes to complete.
                        <br>
                        In a daring raid 120 miles (192km) inside Pakistan, a team of US special forces flew from
                        Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hiding place in the dead of night. They swooped down on the compound
                        in stealth helicopters, swept through the buildings within the high walled enclosure and shot
                        dead a total of five people including Bin Laden.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Around 40 minutes later they left, taking with them Bin Laden's body and a hoard of computer
                        data devices and other information containing intelligence about al-Qaeda and Bin Laden's
                        activities.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        They left behind the other dead, among whom were a woman and one of Bin Laden's sons. They also
                        left a group of three women and 13 children - two girls and 11 boys - bound with plastic ties.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The US team was forced to abandon one of its helicopters after it was damaged in a hard landing
                        at the compound site. It was mostly destroyed in an explosion set by the US forces as they
                        departed.
                        <br><br>

                        Publicly, the US authorities have given few details about the raid and some of these have
                        changed since the news of Bin Laden's death was officially announced.
