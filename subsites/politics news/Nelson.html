                        Nelson Mandela, leader of the movement to end South African apartheid, is released from prison
                        after 27 years on February 11, 1990.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 1944, Mandela, a lawyer, joined the African National Congress (ANC), the oldest Black
                        political organization in South Africa, where he became a leader of Johannesburg’s youth wing of
                        the ANC. In 1952, he became deputy national president of the ANC, advocating nonviolent
                        resistance to apartheid—South Africa’s institutionalized system of white supremacy and racial
                        segregation. However, after the massacre of peaceful Black demonstrators at Sharpeville in 1960,
                        Nelson helped organize a paramilitary branch of the ANC to engage in guerrilla warfare against
                        the white minority government.
                        In 1961, he was arrested for treason, and although acquitted he was arrested again in 1962 for
                        illegally leaving the country. Convicted and sentenced to five years at Robben Island Prison, he
                        was put on trial again in 1964 on charges of sabotage. In June 1964, he was convicted along with
                        several other ANC leaders and sentenced to life in prison.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail at the brutal Robben Island Prison. Confined
                        to a small cell without a bed or plumbing, he was forced to do hard labor in a quarry. He could
                        write and receive a letter once every six months, and once a year he was allowed to meet with a
                        visitor for 30 minutes. However, Mandela’s resolve remained unbroken, and while remaining the
                        symbolic leader of the anti-apartheid movement, he led a movement of civil disobedience at the
                        prison that coerced South African officials into drastically improving conditions on Robben
                        Island. He was later moved to another location, where he lived under house arrest.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In 1989, F.W. de Klerk became South African president and set about dismantling apartheid. De
                        Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC, suspended executions, and in February 1990 ordered the release
                        of Nelson Mandela.
