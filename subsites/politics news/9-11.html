                    <p>
                        It kept getting worse.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The horror arrived in episodic bursts of chilling disbelief, signified first by trembling
                        floors, sharp eruptions, cracked windows. There was the actual unfathomable realization of a
                        gaping, flaming hole in first one of the tall towers, and then the same thing all over again in
                        its twin. There was the merciless sight of bodies helplessly tumbling out, some of them in
                        flames.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, the mighty towers themselves were reduced to nothing. Dense plumes of smoke raced
                        through the downtown avenues, coursing between the buildings, shaped like tornadoes on their
                        sides.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Every sound was cause for alarm. A plane appeared overhead. Was another one coming? No, it was a
                        fighter jet. But was it friend or enemy? People scrambled for their lives, but they didn't know
                        where to go. Should they go north, south, east, west? Stay outside, go indoors? People hid
                        beneath cars and each other. Some contemplated jumping into the river.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For those trying to flee the very epicenter of the collapsing World Trade Center towers, the
                        most horrid thought of all finally dawned on them: nowhere was safe.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For several panic-stricken hours yesterday morning, people in Lower Manhattan witnessed the
                        inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the unthinkable. ''I don't know what the gates of hell look
                        like, but it's got to be like this,'' said John Maloney, a security director for an Internet
                        firm in the trade center. ''I'm a combat veteran, Vietnam, and I never saw anything like this.''
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first warnings were small ones. Blocks away, Jim Farmer, a film composer, was having
                        breakfast at a small restaurant on West Broadway. He heard the sound of a jet. An odd sound --
                        too loud, it seemed, to be normal. Then he noticed: ''All the pigeons in the street flew up.''
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was the people outside, on the sidewalk, who saw the beginning. At 8:45, David Blackford was
                        walking toward work in a downtown building. He heard a jet engine and glanced up. ''I saw this
                        plane screaming overhead,'' he said. ''I thought it was too low. I thought it wasn't going to
                        clear the tower.''
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Within moments, his fears were confirmed. The plane slammed into the north face of 1 World Trade
                        Center. As he watched, he said, ''You could see the concussion move up the building.''
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        ''It was a large plane flying low,'' said Robert Pachino, another witness. ''There was no engine
                        trouble. He didn't try to maneuver. This plane was on a mission.''
