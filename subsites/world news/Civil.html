                        During Reconstruction, Black people took on leadership roles like never before. They held public
                        office and sought legislative changes for equality and the right to vote.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In 1868, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution gave Black people equal protection under the
                        law. In 1870, the 15th Amendment granted Black American men the right to vote. Still, many white
                        Americans, especially those in the South, were unhappy that people they’d once enslaved were now
                        on a more-or-less equal playing field.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        To marginalize Black people, keep them separate from white people and erase the progress they’d
                        made during Reconstruction, “Jim Crow” laws were established in the South beginning in the late
                        19th century. Black people couldn’t use the same public facilities as white people, live in many
                        of the same towns or go to the same schools. Interracial marriage was illegal, and most Black
                        people couldn’t vote because they were unable to pass voter literacy tests.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Jim Crow laws weren’t adopted in northern states; however, Black people still experienced
                        discrimination at their jobs or when they tried to buy a house or get an education. To make
                        matters worse, laws were passed in some states to limit voting rights for Black Americans.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Moreover, southern segregation gained ground in 1896 when the U.S. Supreme Court declared in
                        Plessy v. Ferguson that facilities for Black and white people could be “separate but equal."
