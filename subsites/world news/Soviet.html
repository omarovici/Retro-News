                    <p>
                        MOSCOW, Saturday, Oct. 5 -- The Soviet Union announced this morning that it successfully launched
                        a man-made earth satellite into space yesterday.
                        The Russians calculated the satellite's orbit at a maximum of 560 miles above the earth and its
                        speed at 18,000 miles an hour.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The official Soviet news agency Tass said the artificial moon, with a diameter of twenty-two
                        inches and a weight of 184 pounds, was circling the earth once every hour and thirty-five
                        minutes. This means more than fifteen times a day.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Two radio transmitters, Tass said, are sending signals continuously on frequencies of 20.005 and
                        40.002 megacycles. These signals were said to be strong enough to be picked up by amateur radio
                        operators. The trajectory of the satellite is being tracked by numerous scientific stations.
                        Due Over Moscow Today
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Tass said the satellite was moving at an angle of 65 degrees to the equatorial plane and would
                        pass over the Moscow area twice today.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        "Its flight," the announcement added, "will be observed in the rays of the rising and setting
                        sun with the aid of the simplest optical instruments, such as binoculars and spyglasses."
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The Soviet Union said the world's first satellite was "successfully launched" yesterday. Thus it
                        asserted that it had put a scientific instrument into space before the United States. Washington
                        has disclosed plans to launch a satellite next spring, Oct. 4.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The Moscow announcement said the Soviet Union planned to send up more and bigger and heavier
                        artificial satellites during the current International Geophysical Year, an eighteen-month
                        period of study of the earth, its crust and the space surrounding it.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Five Miles a Second
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The rocket that carried the satellite into space left the earth at a rate of five miles a
                        second, the Tass announcement said. Nothing was revealed, however, concerning the material of
                        which the man-made moon was constructed or the site in the Soviet Union where the sphere was
                        launched.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The Soviet Union said its sphere circling the earth had opened the way to interplanetary travel.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        It did not pass up the opportunity to use the launching for propaganda purposes. It said in its
                        announcement that people now could see how "the new socialist society" had turned the boldest
                        dreams of mankind into reality.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Moscow said the satellite was the result of years of study and research on the part of Soviet
                        scientists.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Several Years of Study
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Tass said: "For several years the research and experimental designing work has been under way in
                        the Soviet Union to create artificial satellites of the earth. It has already been reported in
                        the press that the launching of the earth satellites in the U.S.S.R. had been planned in
                        accordance with the program of International Geophysical Year research.
