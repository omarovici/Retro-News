                        Exchanges jam in clamour of exit inquiries
<br>
<br>
                        East Germany's ruling Communist Party last night took the momentous step of allowing all
                        citizens direct passage to the West in a step that renders obsolete the Berlin Wall and puts
                        into question the border between the two Germanies. The extraordinary announcement represents
                        the single most dramatic transformation of the political map of post-war Europe. It follows a
                        tumultuous week during which the Communist authorities have vainly sought to stem a tide of
                        popular opposition.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Within hours, East Germans on foot and in cars began arriving in West Germany and West Berlin .
                        West German television said a couple crossed the Bornholmer Strasse checkpoint in West Berlin at
                        9.15 pm (8.15 GMT) with identity cards stamped with the new-style visas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The decision was announced by Mr Guenter Schabowski, a politburo member, after the second day of
                        a central committee meeting in East Berlin . He said it would come into effect immediately, and
                        would last until new travel regulations were passed into law.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Soon afterwards, the official ADN news agency said tens of thousands of people, many probably
                        unaware of the new travel rules, took to the streets in several cities demanding free elections
                        and liberalised travel.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When East German television carried the announcement, the station's switchboard was jammed
                        almost instantly as thousands of callers tried to elicit more information.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was also announced yesterday that East Germany's parliament will meet on Monday to elect a
                        new Prime Minister, and charge him with forming a new government. The Communist Party has
                        nominated the reformist, Mr Hans Modrow, for the top job in the government, after the former
                        administration under the hardliner, Mr Willi Stoph, resigned on Tuesday, the day before the
                        politburo stepped down to make way for a new team.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        East Germans will be able to obtain exit visas without delay, allowing them to cross into the
                        West through all border points within Berlin and along the border with West Germany. Tourists
                        who want to return to East Germany can also obtain immediate permission. Because of the
                        exceptional nature of the decision, passports will not be needed. 'We have decided today that
                        all East Germans who want to leave permanently can do so without delay.'
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The two days of hectic change in East Berlin received the public blessing yesterday of the
                        Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, Mr Gennady Gerasimov, who said: 'These changes are for the
                        better, that is for sure.'
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He hinted that the Soviet Union would be prepared to accept a non-Communist government in East
                        Germany. 'It's their (East Germany's) decision, just like in Poland .. Poland is a good member
                        of the Warsaw Pact, and in Poland you have a coalition, you don't have Communist government in
                        Poland.'
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The numbers fleeing East Germany this year have now topped 200,000. Since last Friday alone,
                        more than 50,000 have left. Yesterday's move has unpredictable consequences, but was clearly
                        taken in the hope that the exodus could be slowed by giving people the opportunity of travelling
                        or leaving whenever they wished.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In a further concession to popular pressure, the Communist Party called a special party
                        conference which could result in leadership purges.
                        <br>
