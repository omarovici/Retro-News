                    <p>
                        NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 29 - Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf Coast with devastating force at
                        daybreak on Monday, sparing New Orleans the catastrophic hit that had been feared but inundating
                        parts of the city and heaping damage on neighboring Mississippi, where it killed dozens, ripped
                        away roofs and left coastal roads impassable.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Officials said that according to preliminary reports, there were at least 55 deaths, with 50
                        alone in Harrison County, Miss., which includes Gulfport and Biloxi. Emergency workers feared
                        that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed
                        buildings.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Jim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the
                        dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial
                        Seaway.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Packing 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in
                        three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the
                        United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it
                        one of the costliest storms on record.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in
                        one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The
                        hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many
                        as 10,000 evacuees took shelter.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Some of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes
                        reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals
                        without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal
                        highway flooded and unpassable.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        "It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks," Gov. Haley Barbour said at a midday news
                        conference "It's a terrible storm."
