                        It is 50 years since the first man walked on the moon. To celebrate this historic event we have
                        front pages from The Observer and The Guardian from July 1969.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Apollo 11 launched on Wednesday 16 July 1969 from the American Kennedy Space Centre in Florida
                        with the purpose of landing safely on the moon. The astronauts tasked with completing the
                        mission were: Commander Neil Armstrong, Lunar Module Pilot Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin and Command
                        Module Pilot Michael Collins. The men had taken part in space missions before.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The spacecraft had to travel for three days before it could enter the lunar orbit. The Apollo
                        spacecraft had three parts: a command module, Columbia, which was the only part to return to
                        Earth, a service module with power, oxygen and water and a lunar module, Eagle, which consisted
                        of two stages - one for landing on the moon and the other to place the astronauts back into
                        lunar orbit.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The Observer front page article by Gerald Leach dated 19 July describes the spacecraft being
                        launched into lunar orbit in preparation for a first attempt to put two men: Neil Armstrong and
                        Buzz Aldrin on the moon. Michael Collins was to stay with the Command Module. Details are given
                        about the time at which mission control in Houston gave permission for the manoeuvre to take
                        place:
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        “Eleven minutes later the spacecraft slid behind the moon and out of contact with control for
                        the first time since leaving Earth’s orbit on Wednesday”. The move was fraught with danger. The
                        craft could have swung wide of the moon or gone into an unstable orbit but the crew described
                        the action as: “like perfect”. The article is full of detail about the preparation for the
                        anticipated moon walk and the planned television coverage of the event.
