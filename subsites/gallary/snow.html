                        What has happened to NSA whistleblower who leaked files to Guardian since he decided to reveal
                        his identity to the world and began his asylum battle
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        20 May Edward Snowden, an employee of defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton at the National
                        Security Agency, arrives in Hong Kong from Hawaii. He carries four laptop computers that enable
                        him to gain access to some of the US government's most highly-classified secrets.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1 June Guardian journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill and documentary maker Laura
                        Poitras fly from New York to Hong Kong. They meet Snowden in a Kowloon hotel after he identifies
                        himself with a Rubik's cube and begin a week of interviews with their source.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        5 June The Guardian publishes its first exclusive based on Snowden's leak, revealing a secret
                        court order showing that the US government had forced the telecoms giant Verizon to hand over
                        the phone records of millions of Americans.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        6 June A second story reveals the existence of the previously undisclosed programme Prism, which
                        internal NSA documents claim gives the agency "direct access" to data held by Google, Facebook,
                        Apple and other US internet giants. The tech companies deny that they have set up "back door
                        access" to their systems for the US government.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        7 June Barack Obama defends the two programmes, saying they are overseen by the courts and
                        Congress. Insisting that "the right balance" had been struck between security and privacy, he
                        says: "You can't have 100% security, and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Guardian reports that GCHQ has been able to see user communications data from the American
                        internet companies, because it had access to Prism.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        8 June Another of Snowden's leaks reveals the existence of an internal NSA tool – Boundless
                        Informant – that allows it to record and analyse where its data comes from, and raises questions
                        about its repeated assurances to Congress that it cannot keep track of all the surveillance it
                        performs on American communications.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        9 June Snowden decides to go public. In a video interview he says: "I have no intention of
                        hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        10 June Snowden checks out of his Hong Kong hotel.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        12 June Hong Kong's South China Morning Post publishes the first interview with Snowden since he
                        revealed his identity. He says he intends to stay in the city until asked to leave and discloses
                        that the NSA has been hacking into Hong Kong and Chinese computers since 2009.
