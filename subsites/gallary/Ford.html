                    <p>
                        DEARBORN - A sparsely worded newswire release was issued on May 22, 1963 noting, “Ford Motor
                        Company and Ferrari wish to indicate, with reference to recent reports of their negotiations
                        toward a possible collaboration that such negotiations have been suspended by mutual agreement.”
                        The flurry of negotiations between the companies had ended, but Ford’s desire to become a player
                        in performance motorsports remained strong. A month later, the High Performance and Special
                        Models Operation Unit was formed with the mission to design and build “A racing GT car that will
                        have the potential to compete successfully in major road races such as Sebring and Le Mans.” The
                        unit’s resulting work, the GT Program book, circulated internally on June 12th and contained the
                        initial design concepts for the GT40.

                        The high performance team included Ford’s Roy Lunn, who already developed a preliminary design
                        in the GT Program Book, along with Carroll Shelby and a few other Ford officials. Their first
                        job was to identify a team that could build the cars. As project engineers, they chose Eric
                        Broadley, whose Lola GT was considered groundbreaking, and John Wyer, who had won Le Mans with
                        Carroll Shelby driving for Aston Martin as the race manager. This established a four-pronged
                        team with Lunn and Broadley designing and building the cars, Wyer establishing the race team and
                        Shelby acting as the front man in Europe. With ten months until the 1964 race, a workshop was
                        established in Broadley’s garage in Bromley, south of London. But when established as Ford
                        Advanced Vehicles moved the operations to Slough.

                        As one of the major design features, Roy Lunn had lowered the height two inches from Broadley’s
                        initial Lola to a mere 40 inches and work on the cars began. Interestingly, the first seven
                        produced had a VIN number beginning with Ford GT, while the cars after those had a VIN beginning
                        with Ford GT40. New Zealander Bruce McLaren was the initial test track driver as the car was put
                        through its paces. Early issues with the car were apparent as the Ford Motor Company team tried
                        to accomplish in 10 months what Ferrari had perfected over decades. By April the first car was
                        completed, and was quickly shipped to New York to be used for a press conference prior to the
                        Mustang launch. During the time trials in Le Mans in mid-April, the car’s speed was tremendous,
                        but the aerodynamics needed work as it was difficult to control at high speeds. With McLaren
                        doing the development driving, a spoiler was added and other modifications made. The car was now
                        as ready for racing as it could be for the 1964 season.

                        Disappointments were soon to follow. While the Ford GT40s were undoubtedly fast, endurance was
                        an issue at all of the races. The suspension let loose in Nuremburg, and while they led for a
                        portion of the race at Le Mans and driver Phil Hill set a lap record, the Colotti gearboxes gave
                        out under the strain of the speed and number of shifts required to complete the loop. All three
                        Ford cars were out of the race 12 hours into the required 24. Further disappointments
                        culminating in a disastrous showing in Nassau in December left the program in shambles, and the
                        decision was made in Dearborn to move the work back to the US, with Carroll Shelby given
                        operational control and Roy Lunn engineering control.
