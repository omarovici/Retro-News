                    <p>
                        In March, The New York Times, working with The Observer of London and The Guardian, obtained a
                        cache of documents from inside Cambridge Analytica, the data firm principally owned by the
                        right-wing donor Robert Mercer. The documents proved that the firm, where the former Trump aide
                        Stephen K. Bannon was a board member, used data improperly obtained from Facebook to build voter
                        profiles. The news put Cambridge under investigation and thrust Facebook into its biggest crisis
                        ever. Here's a guide to our coverage.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        MARCH 17
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Harvesting data and testing election law
                        The Times reported that in 2014 contractors and employees of Cambridge Analytica, eager to sell
                        psychological profiles of American voters to political campaigns, acquired the private Facebook
                        data of tens of millions of users — the largest known leak in Facebook history.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        There was more. Our article first showed how Cambridge received warnings from its own lawyer,
                        Laurence Levy, as it employed European and Canadian citizens on campaigns, potentially violating
                        American election law. The Times also found that tranches of raw data still existed beyond
                        Facebook's control.

                        Read how researchers may have used your Facebook “likes” to predict your political views.
                        What was the Russia link?
                        In a companion piece, The Times reported that people at Cambridge Analytica and its British
                        affiliate, the SCL Group, were in contact with executives from Lukoil, the Kremlin-linked oil
                        giant, as Cambridge built its Facebook-derived profiles. Lukoil was interested in the ways data
                        was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders. SCL and Lukoil
                        denied that the talks were political in nature and said the oil giant never became a client.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        MARCH 18
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Anger on both sides of the Atlantic
                        The articles drew an instant response in Washington, where lawmakers demanded that Mark
                        Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, testify before Congress. Democrats looking into Russian
                        interference in the 2016 election — already interested in Cambridge's role in providing
                        analytics to the Trump campaign — said they would seek an investigation into the leak. They were
                        echoed by lawmakers in Britain investigating Cambridge Analytica's role in disinformation and
                        the country's referendum to leave the European Union.
