                        By the end it all felt very familiar. There again was the goalkeeper, Essam El Hadary, bouncing
                        up and down on the crossbar. There again was the coach, Hassan Shehata, being thrown in the air
                        by his players like a birthday boy being given the bumps. And there, yet again, was Ahmed
                        Hassan, receiving the cup from Issa Hayatou, raising it and pointing his finger in the air in
                        thanks to Allah. As it was in Cairo, as it was in Accra, so it was again in Luanda.

                        <br>
                        By winning an unprecedented third consecutive Cup of Nations, this Egypt side have confirmed
                        their place in history. They will not be at this summer's World Cup finals in South Africa but
                        this may be the best team Africa has produced. Records were broken or extended wherever you
                        looked.

                        This is Egypt's seventh title, three more than their nearest challengers, Cameroon and Ghana,
                        who must now live in the knowledge that they have only won as many as Hassan, Egypt's remarkable
                        captain. Five other players  This is Egypt's seventh title, three more than their nearest
                        challengers, Cameroon and Ghana, who must now live in the knowledge that they have won only as
                        many as Hassan, Egypt's remarkable captain. Five other players  El Hadary, Hany Said, Wael
                        Gomaa, Ahmed Fathy and Emad Meteeb  played in all three finals, while Shehata who, after 18
                        games, is still unbeaten in the competition, equalled the Ghanaian CK Gyamfi's record of three
                        titles as coach.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As in those previous two finals Egypt were not especially convincing. They were the best team in
                        the tournament and deserved their success but they were perhaps fortunate that a youthful Ghana
                        could not find penetration to match their passing. Asamoah Gyan, a figure reborn in this
                        competition, toiled heroically alone up front but their coach, Milovan Rajevac, will know he was
                        left too isolated. Only with a couple of free-kicks, one just too high and one flapped uneasily
                        wide by El Hadary, did they go close.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The game, in the end, was decided by the prolific substitute Mohamed Gedo, who took his tally
                        for the tournament to five and confirmed himself as top scorer, as he played a one-two with
                        Mohamed Zidan, advanced into the box and curled a precise finish beyond Richard Kingson. There
                        were Ghanaian tears at the end, but Rajevac's side are too gifted, too matureThere were Ghanaian
                        tears at the end, but Rajevac's side are too gifted, too mature to fade away, and will surely be
                        back. This Egypt, though, perhaps will not. This has been one of the greatest of all
                        generations, but, as their general manager Samir Adly acknowledged, the sense is that the sun
                        may be setting on their golden age.Ghana (4-2-3-1) Kingson; Inkoom, Addy, Vorsah, Sarpei;
