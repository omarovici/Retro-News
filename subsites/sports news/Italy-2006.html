                        The 2006 World Cup in Germany is one of the finest of the modern era and remembered for many
                        reasons.
                        <br><br>
                        It had a bit of everything – football’s older stars making a mark, from Zinedine Zidane to
                        Ronaldo, as the new ones began to make a name for themselves – think Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel
                        Messi, Lukas Podolski and more.
                        <br><br>

                        Then, the great goals, as a host of excellent strikes made a tough Goal of the Tournament
                        competition, as well as the hosts, who had some fantastic stadiums on display. Above all, the
                        Italians had an unforgettable summer that year.
                        <br><br>

                        Overcoming the Calciopoli scandal
                        Going into the World Cup, there was doubt aplenty around Italy. The country’s football structure
                        was in turmoil, as Calciopoli – the Italian match fixing scandal – dominated headlines and
                        raised questions about the integrity about the sport in the country.
                        <br><br>

                        Juventus were stripped of the previous two league titles they had won, as they, along with
                        others, were handed hefty fines, points deductions or relegations, leaving many players
                        questioning their future and putting their World Cup hopes in doubt.
                        <br><br>

                        At the tournament, the topic of Calciopoli engulfed the Italian squad, and especially its
                        Juventus players. Five players from the Bianconeri went to the tournament in Germany, including
                        captain Fabio Cannavaro, star goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, forward Alessandro Del Piero,
                        starting right-back Gianluca Zambrotta and wide man Mauro Camoranesi.
                        <br><br>

                        But while there was controversy surrounding them, together, they were a unit. A band of
                        brothers. A team that had one thing on their mind: bringing home the fourth World Cup, and they
                        were led by Marcello Lippi for the goal.
                        <br><br>
