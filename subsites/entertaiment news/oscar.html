                        On March 27, 1973, the actor Marlon Brando declines the Academy Award for Best Actor for his
                        career-reviving performance in The Godfather. The actress and activist Sacheen Littlefeather
                        attended the ceremony in Brando’s place, stating that the actor “very regretfully” could not
                        accept the award, as he was protesting Hollywood’s portrayal of Native Americans in film.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now revered by many as the greatest actor of his generation, Brando earned his first Oscar
                        nomination for his portrayal of the brutish Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).
                        The role was a reprisal of Brando’s incendiary performance in the 1947 stage production of
                        Tennessee Williams’ play, which first brought him to the public’s attention. Nominated again for
                        roles in Viva Zapata! (1952) and Julius Caesar (1953), he won his first Academy Award for On the
                        Waterfront (1954).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Brando’s career went into decline in the 1960s, with expensive flops such as One-Eyed Jacks
                        (1961), which he also directed, and Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). Aside from his preternatural
                        talent, the actor had become notorious for his moodiness and demanding on-set behavior, as well
                        as his tumultuous off-screen life. Francis Ford Coppola, the young director of The Godfather,
                        had to fight to get him cast in the coveted role of Vito Corleone. Brando won the role only
                        after undergoing a screen test and cutting his fee to $250,000–far less than what he had
                        commanded a decade earlier. With one of the most memorable screen performances of all time,
                        Brando rejuvenated his career, and The Godfather became an almost-immediate classic.

                        <br>
                        On the eve of the 1972 Oscars, Brando announced that he would boycott the ceremony, and would
                        send Littlefeather in his place. After Brando’s name was announced as Best Actor, the presenter
                        Roger Moore (star of several James Bond films) attempted to hand the Oscar to Littlefeather, but
                        she brushed it aside, saying that Brando could not accept the award. Littlefeather read a
                        portion of a lengthy statement Brando had written, the entirety of which was later published in
                        the press, including The New York Times. “The motion picture community has been as responsible
                        as any,” Brando wrote, “for degrading the Indian and making a mockery of his character,
                        describing his as savage, hostile and evil.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Brando had been involved in social causes for years, speaking publicly in support of the
                        formation of a Jewish state in the 1940s, as well as for African American civil rights and the
                        Black Panther Party. His Oscar statement expressed support for the American Indian Movement
                        (AIM) and referenced the ongoing situation at Wounded Knee, the South Dakota town that had been
                        seized by AIM members the previous month and was currently under siege by U.S. military forces.
                        Wounded Knee had also been the site of a massacre of Native Americans by U.S. government forces
                        in 1890.
