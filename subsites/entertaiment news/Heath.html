                    <p>
                        On January 22, 2008, Hollywood mourns a talented young actor’s life cut tragically short, after
                        the body of 28-year-old Heath Ledger is found by his masseuse and housekeeper on the floor of
                        his rented apartment in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Best known for his Academy Award-nominated turn as the closeted gay cowboy Ennis Del Mar in the
                        director Ang Lee’s acclaimed Brokeback Mountain (2005), Ledger was a former child actor from
                        Australia who first became known to American audiences in the 1999 teen comedy 10 Things I Hate
                        About You. He later passed up other teen comedies and was rewarded with a big break when he
                        landed the role of Mel Gibson’s son in the Revolutionary War drama The Patriot (2000). After
                        appearing in the well-reviewed Monster’s Ball (2001), Ledger starred in two critical and
                        commercial flops, A Knight’s Tale (2001) and The Four Feathers (2002). He roared back in 2005,
                        with lead roles in no fewer than four films, including Casanova, in which he played the title
                        role.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        It was Brokeback Mountain, however, that truly made Ledger a star and earned him comparisons to
                        acting greats such as Marlon Brando. Ledger lost the Best Actor Oscar to Philip Seymour Hoffman
                        (Capote) but Brokeback Mountain cemented his reputation as an A-list actor and a fixture in the
                        pages of celebrity-obsessed magazines. This last role—which he fulfilled uneasily—was
                        intensified by his relationship with the actress Michelle Williams, whom he met on the set of
                        Brokeback Mountain. The couple had a daughter, Matilda, born in October 2005, and were often
                        photographed in various scenes of domestic bliss. In September 2007, however, Ledger and
                        Williams announced they were separating, and Ledger moved from their house in Brooklyn to the
                        rented SoHo apartment.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Though his personal life might have been in turmoil, Ledger’s professional life was flourishing
                        in the months before his death. Near the end of 2007, he was in London filming Terry Gilliam’s
                        The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. In addition to a role as one of several Bob Dylan alter
                        egos in Todd Haynes’ I’m Not There, he had also recently finished work on The Dark Knight, the
                        latest Batman film, in which Ledger played a younger version of the Joker, the villainous role
                        originated by Jack Nicholson. In interviews that would be scrutinized exhaustively after his
                        death, the actor admitted that the Joker role had been difficult for him and that he had been
                        using prescription drugs to manage recurring bouts of stress and insomnia.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Soon after the masseuse and housekeeper discovered Ledger’s body, emergency crews arrived on the
                        scene but were unable to revive him. Media speculation about his possible illegal drug use
                        intensified over the next two weeks, until on February 8, the New York City Medical Examiner’s
                        Office released the results of toxicology tests performed on Ledger’s body. The report stated
                        that he died of an accidental “abuse of prescription medications” that included commonly known
                        painkillers, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills. After memorial services in New York and Los
                        Angeles, Ledger’s family took his body back to their native Australia; he was cremated at a
                        private funeral service attended by his family.
