                        Marilyn Monroe, a troubled beauty who failed to find happiness as Hollywood’s brightest star,
                        was discovered dead in her Brentwood home of an apparent overdose of sleeping pills Sunday.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The blond, 36-year-old actress was nude, lying face down on her bed and clutching a telephone
                        receiver in her hand when a psychiatrist broke into her room at 3:30 a.m.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        She had been dead an estimated six to eight hours.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        About 5:15 p.m. Saturday she had called the psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson, and was told to go
                        for a ride when she complained she could not sleep, police reported.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Her body was taken to the County Morgue, where Coroner Theodore J. Curphey said after an autopsy
                        that he could give a “presumptive opinion” that death was due to an overdose of some drug.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        He said a special “suicide team” would be asked to investigate Miss Monroe’s last days to
                        determine if she took her own life.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Further medical tests as to the nature of the suspected killer drug will be completed in 48
                        hours, he said.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        An empty bottle found among several medicines beside her bed had contained 50 Nembutal capsules.
                        The prescription was issued only two or three days ago and the capsules were to be taken in
                        doses of one a night, said Dr. Hyman Engelberg.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Believed in Depressed Mood
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        It was learned that medical authorities believed Miss Monroe had been in a depressed mood
                        recently. She was unkempt and in need of a manicure and pedicure, indicating listlessness and a
                        lack of interest in maintaining her usually glamorous appearance, the authorities added.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The coroner’s office listed the death on its records as possible suicide while the police report
                        said death was possibly accidental.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        No suicide note was found.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Dr. Robert Litman, a psychiatrist serving on the suicide team, said notes are left by less than
                        40% of those who take their own lives. Miss Monroe’s body was discovered after her housekeeper
                        and companion, Mrs. Eunice Murray, awoke about 3 a.m. and saw a light still burning in the
                        actress’ room.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Mrs. Murray found the bedroom door locked. She was unable to arouse Miss Monroe by shouts and
                        rapping on the door, and immediately telephoned Dr. Greenson.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Broke Bedroom Window
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Dr. Greenson took a poker from the fireplace, smashed in a window and climbed into the room.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He told Det. Sgt. R. E. Byron that Miss Monroe was under a sheet and champagne-colored blanket
                        which were tucked up around her shoulders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Dr. Greenson took the telephone receiver from her hand and told Mrs. Murray, “She appears to be
                        dead.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He called Dr. Engelberg, who had prescribed the sleeping pills for the actress, who pronounced
                        her dead on his arrival at the house a short time later. Dr. Engelberg called police at 4:20
                        a.m. and two officers arrived in five minutes, followed by Sgt. Byron at 5 a.m.
